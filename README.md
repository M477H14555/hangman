This game is a digital verson of the game Hangman. For those who don't know what hangman is, it isn't a game about death or hanging yourself but about words. 
You have to guess letters to spell out a word. If you choose a letter not in the word, you will draw a pole bit by bit and a person hung off of the pole. 
The game ends when one figures out the word or you fully draw the pole and the person getting hung.


that's it really. :]
